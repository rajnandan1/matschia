# Migration Guide: Node.js to Python

This document explains how the Twitter Analysis Tool has been migrated from a Node.js/Python hybrid to a pure Python solution.

## Migration Summary

The Twitter Analysis Tool originally used:

-   Node.js with Playwright for web scraping
-   Python for the AI-based analysis

The migration converted all Node.js components to Python equivalents, resulting in a unified Python codebase.

## Key Changes

1. **Replaced Node.js Playwright Code**:

    - Converted `chrome-playwright-wrapper.js` to `tweet_scraper.py`
    - Implemented equivalent functionality using Python's Playwright library

2. **Converted Helper Scripts**:

    - Created `scrape.py` as a Python replacement for `scrape.js`
    - Created `test.py` as a Python replacement for `test.js`

3. **Updated Dependencies**:

    - Added Python Playwright to `requirements.txt`
    - Removed Node.js dependencies (package.json can now be deleted)

4. **Updated Runner Script**:
    - Modified `run_twitter_analysis.sh` to use Python scripts instead of Node.js

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Simplified Codebase**:

    - Single language ecosystem (Python)
    - Easier maintenance and updates
    - Consistent coding patterns

2. **Reduced Dependencies**:

    - No need for Node.js runtime
    - Fewer external dependencies
    - Simplified installation process

3. **Improved Integration**:
    - Direct data exchange between components
    - No need for JSON file intermediaries between languages
    - Potential for tighter integration in future updates

## Files That Can Be Removed

The following Node.js files are no longer needed and can be safely deleted:

-   `chrome-playwright-wrapper.js`
-   `scrape.js`
-   `test.js`
-   `package.json`
-   `package-lock.json`
-   `node_modules/` directory (if exists)

## Running the Migrated Application

The application is run in the same way as before:

```bash
./run_twitter_analysis.sh
```

All functionality remains identical, but now running on a pure Python stack.

## May 25, 2025 Update

1. **Project Cleanup**:
    - Removed unused test and example scripts
    - Consolidated functionality into core modules
    - Updated documentation to reflect current project structure
